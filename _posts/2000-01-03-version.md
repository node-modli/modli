## Model Versioning

When a model is added it gets a `version` property. This version is
then used for both validation and sanitization meaning both input and
output data are aligned with the model in use.

Models can contain any number of versions using any format preferred:

{% highlight javascript linenos=table %}
// Version 1
model.add({
  name: 'modliTest',
  version: 1
  schema: { /*...*/ }
});

// Version 2
model.add({
  name: 'modliTest',
  version: 2
  schema: { /*...*/ }
});

// ...
{% endhighlight %}

Modli will always default to the last version added so if only one
version exists, or a method does not receive a version it will use
choose the latest.

Specifying the model to use may vary slightly by adapter, but typically
it's an (optional) param on the method, for example:

{% highlight javascript linenos=table %}
// Create record using version 1 of the model:
myDataSource.create({ /*... data ... */ }, 1)
{% endhighlight %}

Modli adapters also sanitize response data objects (and arrays) so if 
the response is different than the model version specified it will 
return the correct data format.
