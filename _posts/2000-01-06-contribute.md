## Contributing

The Modli project was started by the talented team of developers at 
[TechnologyAdvice](http://www.technologyadvice.com) to solve a problem. 
We had multiple data sources and multiple methods for interacting.

We believe highly in the benefits of open source software and while we 
use Modli internally every day we want to make it available to everyone.

If you'd like to help out please fork and then submit pull requests on 
any of the repo's, especially the adapters :)

We're sticklers for clean, readable, and maintainable code so we hope that 
you will find the code easy to work with. Feel free to submit issues to 
the core or any of the adapters.
