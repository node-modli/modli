# Modli

A module for building models and adapters for multiple data sources. The core
goal of this project is to create a minimal barrier to entrance for creating
model-validated CRUD operations on data sources.

This is done by addressing two core areas:

**Models**

Create a simple, universally similar modeling structure for any and all data
sources to which an application may be connected.

**Adapters**

Create basic CRUD operations that function similarly between all adapters
which can be connected to a model to perform the CRUD operations and are easily
extensible for more complex operations.

## Installation

```
npm install modli --save
```

## Getting Started

Below is an example of a basic setup where a **model** and an **adapter** 
are added. Once added they are available to be `use`'d to create an 
instance of the object with the methods from the adapter, validation, etc:

```javascript
import { model, adapter, use, Joi } from 'modli';

// Create adapter object
adapter.add({
  name: 'testNEDB',
  // Uses the built-in NeDB adapter
  source: 'nedb',
  // Initiates adapter with following config
  config: {
    inMemoryOnly: true
  }
});

// Add a Model
model.add({
  // Set a name
  name: 'testUser',
  // Set the version
  version: 1,
  // Define the schema
  schema: {
    id: Joi.number().integer(),
    fname: Joi.string().min(3).max(30),
    lname: Joi.string().min(3).max(30),
    email: Joi.string().email().min(3).max(254).required()
  }
});

// Create user object by using the model and adapter
const user = use('testUser', 'testNEDB');
```

The above example will return the model object with a number of methods for
performing data operations. This will always include core CRUD methods:

```javascript
// Create
user.create({ /*...data...*/ }).then(/*...*/).catch(/*...*/);

// Read
user.read({ /*...query...*/ }).then(/*...*/).catch(/*...*/);

// Update
user.update({ /*...query, data...*/ }).then(/*...*/).catch(/*...*/);

// Delete
user.delete({ /*...query...*/ }).then(/*...*/).catch(/*...*/);
```

*Yes, it's all based on Promises. You're welcome.*

## Examples

As often times it is easier to understand something when seen in practice, there
are several [examples](/examples) available.

The [`/test/index.int.js`](/test/index.int.js) file also serves as an integration
test suite which shows how functionality of Modli is designed.

### Validate Model Data

Validating a model (using the above example) is then simply a matter of the
model's `validate` method which returns any (or `null`)  validation errors:

```javascript
// Some data
const testData = {
  id: 12345,
  fname: 'John',
  lname: 'Doe',
  email: 'jdoe@gmail.com'
};

// Run validation against testData with model version 1
const validationErrors = someModel.validate(testData, 1);
if (!validationErrors) {
  // Everything passed
  console.log('Passed!');
} else {
  // Failed, logs 'Failed' along with the validation errors
  console.log('Failed', validationErrors);
}
```

### Validation Error Formatting

By default, the `validation` methods `fail` response will return the Joi error
object. This can be overridden using the following:

```javascript
model.customValidationError = (err) => {
  // ... custom formatting here ...
};
```

For example, if you wanted to just show the "human" error response text:

```javascript
model.customValidationError = (err) => {
  return err.details[0].message;
}
```

The above would return `"id" must be a number` if the above model was tested
with an invalid (`string`) id.

## Adapters

*Please see the [Adapters Readme](/src/adapters) for additional information.*

Adapters allow for creating standard CRUD methods which are then extended upon
the model to make interacting with the datasource simple.

### Default methods

All adapters have 6 main methods which are exposed on the model; `create`, `read`,
`update`, `delete`, `config` and `extend`.

While these methods are mostly self-explanatory, some noteworthy specifics:

The `config` method is called automatically by the model when the adapter is
bound to it (see above model example).

The `extend` method allows adapters to be dynamically built upon. An example of
this method would be:

```javascript
import { myAdapter } from '/path/to/myAdapter';
// namespace: myAdapter
myAdapter.extend = (name, fn) => {
  myAdapter[name] = fn.bind(nedb);
};
```

### Adapters and Validation

When the adapter is extended upon the model to which it is applied it exposes
the `model`'s `validate` method. Adapters can utilize this via the following:

```javascript
// namespace: myAdapter
const validationErrors = myAdapter.validate(body);
```

The `validate` method in the above returns errors to the `validationErrors`
constant. If no validation errors are present it simply returns `null`.

## Makefile and Scripts

A `Makefile` is included for managing build and install tasks. The commands are
then referenced in the `package.json` `scripts` if that is the preferred
task method:

* `all` (default) will run all build tasks
* `start` will run the main script
* `clean` will remove the `/node_modules` directories
* `build` will transpile ES2015 code in `/src` to `/build`
* `test` will run all spec files in `/test/src`
* `test-libs` will test modli's libs
* `test-adapters` will test all adapters
* `test-integration` will run integration test
* `test-cover` will run code coverage on all tests
* `lint` will lint all files in `/src`

## Testing

Running `make test` will run the full test suite. Since adapters require a data 
source if one is not configured the tests will fail. To counter this tests are 
able to be broken up.

**Core Modli Tests**

When working on core Modli functionality (i.e. the `/src/libs`) running the 
`make test-libs` command will unit test the code.

**Adapter Tests**

When building (mostly in CI) if all adapters have access to test data sources the 
`make test-adapters` command will run all tests on `/src/adapters`.

**Test Inidividual File**

An individual spec can be run by specifying the `FILE`. This is convenient when 
working on an individual adapter.

```
make test FILE=some.spec.js
```

The `FILE` is relative to the `test/src/` directory.

**Deploys**

For deploying releases, the `deploy TAG={VERSION}` can be used where `VERSION` can be:

```
<newversion> | major | minor | patch | premajor
```

Both `make {COMMAND}` and `npm run {COMMAND}` work for any of the above commands.
